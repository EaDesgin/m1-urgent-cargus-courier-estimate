# M1 Urgent Cargus courier estimate

You can find the Urgent-Cargus Courier Estimate - Commercial Version here

The shipping extension uses web services to generate the exact costs based on the city, region and weight of the items in cart. The extension can also import the cities from Romania and then uses a Levenshtein algorithm to correct the cities written by the user so the estimation can be done if he did not write the exact city. The cities import and the web services are from The Romanian courier Urgent-Cargus. (https://www.urgent-curier.ro/)

The extension can be configured from the shipping methods are. It is only available for Romania. We developed this extension from the need to get the shipping costs live based on exact data.

During the next weeks we will release the AWB module. The new module will integrate also the tracking number generation with Magento admin.
